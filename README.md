## Trimethoprim-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of trimethoprim as MATE1, OCT1, OCT2 and CYP2C8 DDI perpetrator drug

### Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of trimethoprim, that has been carefully developed using a large number of clinical studies and evaluated within our DDI modeling network. 
The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of all published clinical studies employed during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].

### Version information
PK-Sim Version 8.0
